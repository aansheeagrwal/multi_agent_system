Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Service Quality

Dear Support Team,

I am extremely disappointed with the recent experience I had with your services. The system was down for over 48 hours and no one from your team responded to our queries. This is completely unacceptable.

Please escalate this issue to the highest level. If I donâ€™t receive a response within 24 hours, I will be forced to take further action.

Regards,
An Angry Customer
